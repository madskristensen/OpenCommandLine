in the Options.

### How it works

This extension adds a new command to the project context menu that will open
a command prompt on the project's path. If the solution node is selection in Solution
Explorer, then a console will open at the root of the .sln file.

You can access the command by hitting **ALT+Space** as well.

You may change this shortcut in the Options Window under Environment -> Keyboard

Look for the command ProjectAndSolutionContextMenus.Project.OpenCommandLine.Default

### Execute batch file

You can easily execute any .cmd or .bat file. For files in your solution,
a context-menu button shows up.

Alternatively, the keyboard shortcut `Shift+Alt+5` can be used when
editing a batch file. This makes it really easy and fast to execute
any batch file - even ones that are not part of your project.
